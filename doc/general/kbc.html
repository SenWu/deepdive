              <h1>Knowledge Base Construction</h1>

<p>Knowledge base construction (KBC) is the process of populating a knowledge base
(KB) with facts (or assertions) extracted from data (e.g., text, audio, video,
tables, diagrams, ...). For example,  one may want to build a medical knowledge
base of interactions between drugs and diseases, a Paleobiology knowledge base
to understand when and where did dinosaurs live, or a knowledge base of people&#39;s
relationships such as spouse, parents or sibling. DeepDive can be used to
facilitate KBC.</p>

<p>As a concrete example, one may use DeepDive to build an application to extract
spouse relations from sentences in the Web. Figure 1 below shows such an
application, where the input consists of sentences like &quot;U.S President Barack
Obama&#39;s wife Michelle Obama ...&quot;, and DeepDive&#39;s output consists of tuples in an
<code>has_spouse</code> table representing the fact that, for example, &quot;Barack Obama&quot; is
married to &quot;Michelle Obama&quot;. DeepDive also produces a probability associated to
the fact, representing the system&#39;s confidence that the fact is true (refer to
the <a href="inference.html">&#39;Probabilistic inference&#39; document</a> for more details
about this concept).</p>

<h3>KBC Terminology</h3>

<p>KBC uses specific terms to refer to the objects it manipulates. The following is
a list of the most important ones</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a name="entity" href="#"></a> An <strong>entity</strong> is an object in the real world,
such as a person, an animal, a time period, a location, etc. For example, the
person &quot;Barack Obama&quot; is an entity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Entity-level data</strong> are relational data over the domain of conceptual
entities (as opposed to language-dependent mentions), such as relations in a
knowledge base, e.g. <a href="http://www.freebase.com/m/02mjmr">&quot;Barack Obama&quot; in
Freebase</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>mention</strong> is a reference to an entity, such as the word &quot;Barack&quot; in the
sentence &quot;Barack and Michelle are married&quot;. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mention-level data</strong> are textual data with mentions of entities, such as
sentences in web articles, e.g. sentences in New York Times articles.</p></li>
<li><p><a name="linking" href="#"></a> <strong>Entity linking</strong> is the process to find out
which entity is a mention referring to. For example, &quot;Barack&quot;, &quot;Obama&quot; or &quot;the
president&quot; may refer to the same entity &quot;Barack Obama&quot;, and entity linking is
the process to figure this out.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>mention-level relation</strong> is a relation among mentions rather than
entities. For example, in a sentence &quot;Barack and Michelle are married&quot;, the
two mentions &quot;Barack&quot; and &quot;Michelle&quot; has a mention-level relation of
<code>has_spouse</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>An <strong>entity-level relation</strong> is a relation among entities. For example, the
entity &quot;Barack Obama&quot; and &quot;Michelle Obama&quot; has an entity-level relation of
<code>has_spouse</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The relationships between these concepts (also known as the data model) is
represented in Figure 2 below.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://deepdive.stanford.edu/images/walkthrough/datamodel.png" alt="Data Model" style="width: 60%; text-align: center;"/>
  <br />
  <strong>Figure 2: Data model for KBC</strong>
</p>

<!-- Note that this data model is what we use in this example walkthrough, but
it isn't the only data model that that can be used for KBC. For example,
traditional distant supervision doesn't necessarily model mention-level
relations in that way (which I think is called at-least-once semantics).
 -->

<h3>KBC Data flow</h3>

<p>In an typical KBC application, the <strong>input</strong> of the system is a collection of
raw articles in text format, while  the <strong>output</strong> of the system is a database
(the KB) containing the desired (entity-level or mention-level) relations.</p>

<p>As explained in the <a href="../basics/overview.html">System overview</a>, the steps to
obtained the output are the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>data preprocessing</li>
<li>feature extraction</li>
<li>factor graph generation by declarative language</li>
<li>statistical inference and learning</li>
</ol>

<p>Specifically:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the <strong>data preprocessing</strong> step, DeepDive takes input data (articles in
text format), loads them into a database, and parse the articles to obtain
sentence-level information including words in each sentence, POS tags, named
entity tags, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>feature extraction</strong> step, DeepDive converts input data into
relation signals called <strong>evidence</strong>, by running <a href="../basics/extractors.html">extractors</a>
written by developers. Evidence includes: (1) candidates for (mention-level or
entity-level) relations; (2) (linguistic) features for these candidates.</p></li>
<li><p>In the next step, DeepDive uses evidence to <strong>generate a <a href="inference.html">factor
graph</a></strong>. To instruct DeepDive about how to generate this
factor graph, developers use a SQL-like declarative language to specify
<a href="../basics/inference_rules.html">inference rules</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the next step, DeepDive automatically performs <strong>learning and statistical
inference</strong> on the generated factor graph.  learning, the values of <a href="inference.html">factor
weights</a> specified in inference rules are calculated.
These weights represent, intuitively, the confidence in the rule. During the
inference step, the marginal probabilities of the variables are computed, which,
in some cases, can represent the probability that a specific fact is true.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>After inference, the results are stored in a set of database tables.  The
developer can <strong>get results</strong> via a SQL query, <strong>check results</strong> with a
<a href="../basics/calibration.html">calibration plot</a>, and perform <strong>error analysis</strong>
to improve results.</p>

<p>As an example of this data flow, Figure 3 demonstrates how a sentence &quot;U.S
President Barack Obama&#39;s wife Michelle Obama...&quot; go through the process (In this
figure, we only highlight step 1--3):</p>

  <br />
  <strong>Figure 3: Data flow for KBC</strong>
</p>

<p>In the example above:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>During data preprocessing, the sentence is processed into words, POS tags and
named entity tags; </p></li>
<li><p>During feature extraction, DeepDive extracts (1) mentions of person and
location, (2) candidate relations of <code>has_spouse</code>, and (3) <code>feature</code> of
candidate relations (such as words between mentions).</p></li>
<li><p>In factor graph generation, DeepDive use rules written by developers (like
<code>inference_rule_1</code> above) to build a factor graph. </p></li>
</ol>
